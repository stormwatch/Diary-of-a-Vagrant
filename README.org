I'll try to install Vagrant and most providers like VirtualBox, libvirt, VMware,
etc. Then I'll download some boxes and test which ones succed or fail when
brought up. My current computer runs Fedora 32, so many of the steps I'll detail
won't apply to other distributions.

If you have =libvirt-client= or =lscpu= already installed, you can run
~virt-host-validate~ or ~LANG= lscpu | grep Virtualization~ respectively. Otherwise run
#+begin_src
egrep "svm|vmx" /proc/cpuinfo
#+end_src

* DONE Install VirtualBox

:END:
I enabled RPM Fusion and followed the instructions in RPM Fusion's [[https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/VirtualBox][VirtualBox
Howto]]. =vboxdrv= might fail to load because the module isn't signed. I can
either disable the secure boot option in the BIOS or [[https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/VirtualBox#Sign_kernel_modules_to_work_with_secure_boot][sign the kernel modules]].
See also this [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1454824][bug report]].

According to [[https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation][Vagrant's Installation instructions]] VirtualBox might also fail if
it is run alongside =kvm=. They suggest blacklisting the offending module.

** DONE Install the guest additions
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-12-06 dom 05:00]
:END:
This package contains the VirtualBox Guest Additions which support better
integration of VirtualBox guests with the Host, including file sharing,
clipboard sharing and Seamless mode

* DONE Install libvirt, qemu-kvm & utilities
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
#+begin_src shell :async :results none
  sudo dnf -yq group install --with-optional virtualization
#+end_src

** TODO Fix =libvirtd.socket=
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-12-04 vie 09:20]
:END:
I wasn't able to configure =libvirtd.socket= yet. It won't start the libvirt
service when needed. I have to start or enable =libvirtd.service= explicitly
instead:
#+begin_src shell
  sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd.service
#+end_src

** DONE Switch to [[https://libvirt.org/daemons.html#switching-to-modular-daemons][modular dæmons]]

libvirtd is migrating from  [[https://libvirt.org/daemons.html#monolithic-vs-modular-daemons][a monolithic to a modular dæmon architecture]]
#+begin_quote
The libvirt daemons, whether monolithic or modular, can often operate in two
modes

- System mode :: the daemon is running as the root user account, enabling access
  to its full range of functionality. A read-write connection to daemons in
  system mode typically implies privileges equivalent to having a root shell.
  Suitable authentication mechanisms must be enabled to secure it against
  untrustworthy clients/users.
- Session mode :: the daemon is running as any non-root user account, providing
  access to a more restricted range of functionality. Only client apps/users
  running under the same UID are permitted to connect, thus a connection does
  not imply any elevation of privileges.
#+end_quote

*** DONE Stop the current monolithic daemon and its socket units
CLOSED: [2020-12-12 sáb 23:22]
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-12-12 sáb 23:17]
:END:
#+begin_src sh :async
  systemctl disable --now libvirtd.service
  systemctl disable --now libvirtd{,-ro,-admin,-tcp,-tls}.socket
#+end_src

For stronger protection it is valid to use =mask= instead of =disable= too.

*** TODO Enable the new daemons for the particular virtualizationd driver desired, and any of the secondary drivers to accompany it.
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-12-12 sáb 23:29]
:END:
The following example enables the =qemu= and =virtbvox= drivers and all the secondary drivers:
#+begin_src sh :async :results none
  for drv in qemu virtvbox interface network nodedev nwfilter secret storage
  do
      systemctl unmask virt${drv}d.service
      systemctl unmask virt${drv}d{,-ro,-admin}.socket
      systemctl enable virt${drv}d.service
      systemctl enable virt${drv}d{,-ro,-admin}.socket
  done
#+end_src

Start the sockets for the same set of daemons. There is no need to start the
services as they will get started when the first socket connection is
established.
# why does the document ommit =virtinterface.socket=?
#+begin_src sh :async :results none
  for drv in qemu virtbvox network nodedev nwfilter secret storage
  do
      systemctl start virt${drv}d{,-ro,-admin}.socket
  done
#+end_src

If connections from remote hosts need to be supported the proxy daemon must be
enabled and started
#+begin_src sh :async :results none
  systemctl unmask virtproxyd.service
  systemctl unmask virtproxyd{,-ro,-admin}.socket
  systemctl enable virtproxyd.service
  systemctl enable virtproxyd{,-ro,-admin}.socket
  systemctl start virtproxyd{,-ro,-admin}.socket
#+end_src

The UNIX sockets allow for remote access using SSH tunneling. If libvirtd had
TCP or TLS sockets configured, those should be started too
#+begin_src sh :async :results none
  systemctl unmask virtproxyd-tls.socket
  systemctl enable virtproxyd-tls.socket
  systemctl start virtproxyd-tls.socket
#+end_src

* DONE Install Vagrant and its libvirt plugin
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-12-04 vie 19:19]
:END:
I have four main choices. The problem is I still cannot figure out which one is
better for my use case.
- Fedora's package :: Easiest installation. Lagging behind the upstream version.
  Won't work with [[https://app.vagrantup.com/peru/boxes/windows-server-2019-standard-x64-eval][Windows guests]]. Since I also use asdf-ruby
  
- [[https://github.com/Banno/asdf-hashicorp][asdf-hashicorp]] :: easy installation. just ~asdf plugin add vagrant; then asdf
  install vagrant latest; then asdf global vagrant 2.2.14~. Unfortunately —as of
  [2020-12-04 vie]— ~vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt~ fails to complete
  but if I'll only stick to VirtualBox it might be an option worth considering.
- Download the [[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads][official Vagrant package]] :: A pain to get it right. [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1833024][Upstream
  isn't compatible with the Fedora version of OpenSSL]]. Ruby in Vagrant is built
  against a bundled version of OpenSSL while during vagrant-libvirt
  installation, the system version of OpenSSL is used and later they clash. The
  workaround is to download OpenSSL and Kerberos 5 source RPM libraries, rebuild
  them and manually copying the shared libraries to
  =/opt/vagrant/embedded/lib64=. Then I can run ~vagrant plugin install
  vagrant-libvirt~ but make sure to remove =~/.vagrant.d= remnant from previous
  attempts beforehand. I found the workarounds and relevant information for
  Fedora, RHEL 8, and CentOS 8 in [[https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt#installation][vagrant-libvirt installation instructions]] and
  this [[https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11020#issuecomment-647120209][Vagrant issue]]. This problem also affects other software like Matlab and
  Scilab. I quote the following comment from [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1829790#c10][another bug report]]:
  #+begin_quote
  …this means those products are using most probably outdated libraries w/o
  getting CVE bugfixes when the system gets them. I would open a bug report
  upstream to stop doing this stupid library interposing on all systems and do
  it only where the proper library version is missing (arguably they do this to
  handle RHEL/CentOS 6 which are stuck on openssl 1.0.2). That said at least
  Matlab is a proprietary product so… good luck, any number of things can break
  when they play fast and loose with critical libraries like openssl.
  #+end_quote
  - Use Windows :: I followed [[https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/other/wsl.html][Vagrant and Windows Subsystem for Linux]]. Looks
    promising but I remember having issues with WSL 2. The tests I made with the
    native version and VirtualBox run fine.
