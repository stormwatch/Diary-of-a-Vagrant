I'll try to install Vagrant and most provider backendslike VirtualBox, libvirt,
VMware, etc. Then I'll download some boxes to test, maybe also bechnmark and
learn about them. My current computer runs Fedora 33, so many of the steps I'll
detail will apply to similar distributions without changes.

Due to time constrainsts, I won't be able to make an exhaustive test of the
different products right away. Some of these technologies are also called
hypervisors which is a funny word that appeared in OS research papers around the
[[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/196405/how-did-the-term-hypervisor-come-into-use][sixties and seventies]] and denotes —at least in its origins— a supervisor of
supervisors.

I enabled RPM Fusion and followed the instructions in RPM Fusion's [[https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/VirtualBox][VirtualBox
Howto]]. =vboxdrv= might fail to load because the module isn't signed. I can
either disable the secure boot option in the BIOS or [[https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/VirtualBox#Sign_kernel_modules_to_work_with_secure_boot][sign the kernel modules]].
See also this [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1454824][bug report]].

According to [[https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation][Vagrant's Installation instructions]] VirtualBox might also fail if
it is run alongside =kvm=. They suggest blacklisting the offending module.

libvirtd is migrating from  [[https://libvirt.org/daemons.html#monolithic-vs-modular-daemons][a monolithic to a modular dæmon architecture]]
#+begin_quote
The libvirt daemons, whether monolithic or modular, can often operate in two
modes

- System mode :: the dæmon is running as the root user account, enabling access
  to its full range of functionality. A read-write connection to daemons in
  system mode typically implies privileges equivalent to having a root shell.
  Suitable authentication mechanisms must be enabled to secure it against
  untrustworthy clients/users.
- Session mode :: the dæmon is running as any non-root user account, providing
  access to a more restricted range of functionality. Only client apps/users
  running under the same UID are permitted to connect, thus a connection does
  not imply any elevation of privileges.
#+end_quote

#+RESULTS:

For stronger protection it is valid to use =mask= instead of =disable= too.

**** DONE Enable the new daemons for the particular virtualizationd driver desired, and any of the secondary drivers to accompany it.

services as they will get started when the first socket connection is
established.

Vagrants abstracts different virtual machine providers under a common API and
configuration layer. VirtualBox, Hyper-V, and Docker are supported right out of
the box, for the rest I have to install plugins.

Here is an overview of the differnet installation methods that I tried out:
- Fedora's package (recommended) :: Easiest installation. Lagging somewhat
  behind the upstream version. Won't work with [[https://app.vagrantup.com/peru/boxes/windows-server-2019-standard-x64-eval][Windows guests]]. Moreover,
  [[https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby][asdf-ruby]] installed runtimes will conflict with Vagrant. The solution is to
  type ~asdf local ruby system~ inside the directory with the Vagrantfile,
  otherwise Vagrant will complain about not being able to find some ruby gems
  and not being able to require =nokogiri=. It has one inconvinience though in
  that Emacs won't be able to find the binary for rubocop (this may affect
  solargraph too). I thought ~asdf local ruby system 2.7.2~ would solve the
  issuse but it didn't.[fn:1] In order to install =vagrant-libvirt= with
  ~vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt~ you have to run ~dnf install
  ruby-devel~ and ~asdf global ruby system~ before; otherwise you can install
  the =vagrant-libvirt= packaged by Fedora.
- [[https://github.com/Banno/asdf-hashicorp][asdf-hashicorp]] :: Easy installation. In fish shell just ~asdf plugin add
  vagrant; then asdf install vagrant latest; then asdf global vagrant x.y.z~ .
  As of [2020-12-04 vie]— ~vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt~ will fail so
  =vagrant-libvirt= kindly provides an alternative [[https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt#using-docker-based-installation][Docker based installation]].
- Download the [[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads][official Vagrant package]] :: Beware that the [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1833024][Upstream Vagrant
  isn't compatible with the Fedora version of OpenSSL]]. Ruby in Vagrant is built
  against a bundled version of OpenSSL while during vagrant-libvirt
  installation, the system version of OpenSSL is used and later they clash. The
  workaround is to download OpenSSL and Kerberos 5 source RPM libraries, rebuild
  them and manually copying the shared libraries to
  =/opt/vagrant/embedded/lib64=. Then I can run ~vagrant plugin install
  vagrant-libvirt~ but make sure to remove the =~/.vagrant.d= remnant from
  previous attempts, beforehand. I found the workarounds and relevant
  information for Fedora, RHEL 8, and CentOS 8 in [[https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt#installation][vagrant-libvirt installation
  instructions]] and in this [[https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11020#issuecomment-647120209][Vagrant issue]]. Similar problems also affect other
  software like Matlab and Scilab. I quote the following comment from [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1829790#c10][another
  bug report]]:
  #+begin_quote
  …this means those products are using most probably outdated libraries w/o
  getting CVE bugfixes when the system gets them. I would open a bug report
  upstream to stop doing this stupid library interposing on all systems and do
  it only where the proper library version is missing (arguably they do this to
  handle RHEL/CentOS 6 which are stuck on openssl 1.0.2). That said at least
  Matlab is a proprietary product so… good luck, any number of things can break
  when they play fast and loose with critical libraries like openssl.
  #+end_quote
- [[https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source][Install from source]] :: clone the GitHub repo and ~bundle install~. Then try to
  use the Docker image for =vagrant-libvirt=.
- Use Windows :: I followed [[https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/other/wsl.html][Vagrant and Windows Subsystem for Linux]]. Looks
  promising but I remember having issues with. The preliminary tests I made with
  the native version and VirtualBox run fine.
   
** Vagrant providers 
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-12-18 vie 01:00]
:END:
A list of Vagrant providers is available in the [[https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search][Vagrant's box search page]]:
- aws
- cloudstack
- digitalocean
- docker
- google
- hyperv
- libvirt
- lxc
- openstack
- parallels
- qemu
- rackspace
- softlayer
- veertu :: Container-like virtualization for MacOS
- virtualbox
- vmware
- vmware_desktop
- vmware_fusion
- vmware_ovf
- wmware_workstation
- vspehere
- xenserver

Vagrant ships out of the box with support for VirtualBox, Hyper-V, and
Docker.For the time being I'll focus on VirtualBox, libvirt and maybe some of
the cloud providers. VMware support on Vagrant [[https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware][isn't free]], and is advertised as
being more performant and stable.

#+begin_quote
Vagrant is free and open source. While the VMware providers are not, the revenue
is used to continue to develop, support, and grow Vagrant and the community
around it.
#+end_quote

** Plugins
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-12-18 vie 00:51]
:END:
The [[https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/tree/main/plugins][core plugins]] implement the basic commands, providers, provisioners, hosts
and guest functionalities.

#+begin_quote
Plugins are powerful, first-class citizens that extend Vagrant using a
well-documented, stable API that can withstand major version upgrades.

In fact, most of the core of Vagrant is [[https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/tree/main/plugins][implemented using plugins]]. Since Vagrant
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food][dogfoods]] its own plugin API, you can be confident that the interface is stable
and well supported.
#+end_quote

Third party plugins implement additional providers, provisioners, and features
like caching, networking, file sharing, etc. Here are some good starting points
to look for Vagrant plugins:

- Your distribution :: if your distribution packages a vagrant plugin, it is a
  good indication that is widely used.
- [[https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/wiki/Available-Vagrant-Plugins][Avaliable Vagrant Plugins]] :: in Vagrant's wiki page at GitHub.
- [[https://github.com/iJackUA/awesome-vagrant#notable-plugins][Notable plugins]] :: is a section in the Awesome Vagrant page at GitHub.
  
There are currently src_shell{gem search --quiet --no-verbose --no-versions
--no-details "(vagrant-|-vagrant)" | wc -l} packages containing =vagrant=. To
retrieve a list with a short description of each one run:
#+begin_src sh :async :exports code :results silent
gem search --quiet --no-verbose --no-versions --details "vagrant-|-vagrant"
